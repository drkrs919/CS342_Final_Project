HYPERPARAMS
16 latent dims

Transposed Convolution model

TRAINING STATS
1 epoch of pretraining
64 epochs of fine tuning
12m pretraining, 5m fine tuning on desktop
0.03 loss on last epoch, would fluctuate below 
regularization off

OTHER NOTES
Using first attempt at a transposed convolutional model

OUTPUT
pretraining:
    top row very light
    gets darker for middle and bottom rows
    rough shape of face, but overall still in a grid and blocky
finetuning:
    shading gone, now simply black/white with no grey
    top row has shaded eye hollows, left cheek
    lower rows have more shading, only top right of forehead, nose, and background are white
