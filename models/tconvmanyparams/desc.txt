HYPERPARAMS
64 latent dims

Transposed Convolution model

TRAINING STATS
2 epoch of pretraining
128 epochs of fine tuning
23m pretraining, 11m fine tuning on desktop
0.0112 loss on last epoch, would fluctuate below 
regularization off

OTHER NOTES
Seeing effects of more parameters on transposed convolution model

OUTPUT
pretraining:
    3x3 grid
    blocky and blurry
    face tilted toward observer's left and down
    lower rows darker
    
finetuning:
    all black or white
    most of selection solid white
    clearly matches edges of input face
    
NEXT STEPS
get rid of 3x3 grid (look into transform for dataloader)
figure out color
