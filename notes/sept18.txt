Color exists with tconv approach as of now. After 2 batches, top row is almost white, middle is tv static, lower is almost black.
Odd how it's still in this 3x3 grid. Something to do with kernel sizes of tconv? Surely not, didn't go away after changing from conv out layers
Almost as if top is being pushed up super high, low is being pushed down super low, and middle is normal. "border lines" of 3x3 match middle row
Each third is EXACLY 5/3 of the image. No way that's organic. Was anything that I put in the model a power of 3?
Seriously has GOT to do with how the training images are being converted to tensors and back.
